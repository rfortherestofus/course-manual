The overall process from start to finish looks something like this: Intro Call Go over terms Discuss timing Share course-making manual Confirm instructor has access to external camera and mic Contract + advance David + instructor sign contract and David pays advance to instructor Set up Infrastructure David sets up shared Google Drive folder David creates Google Sheet for course outline Develop Outline Explain how lessons work (e.g. video, your turn, solutions, learn more) Develop slides David shares rruthemes package to be used Instructor develops slides David approves slides Record Videos Instructor records single test video David approves test video Instructor records remaining videos, including solutions Edit videos David’s video editor edits videos Put content on website Final approval from instructor Marketing for course launch David + instructor develop email sequence David + instructor plan out social media launch Add content to website Make landing page for course All material added to website Course launch! "],["curriculum-development.html", "1 Curriculum Development", " 1 Curriculum Development You’ll develop your curriculum as a combination of slides, exercises, and examples. Here’s how I’ve used the three, but please note that this is just my approach. I want you to think about what’s going to work best for your materials. I start out each section of my course with slides. In my courses, a section is RMarkdown or data wrangling and analysis or data visualization. I have a slide with the section title that I display as I talk through an overview of that section. Each lesson within a section should be short and focus on a single topic. As you’re making your materials, if you think that a video demonstrating the concept will go beyond 5 minutes or so, consider breaking it into multiple lessons. I typically start a lesson with slides. I’ll start with a slide that lays out the concept. I’ll often have code on this slide. I’ll usually then flip over to RStudio to show myself typing out the code to demonstrate this concept in an exercises file. Here’s an example: In my Fundamentals of R course, I had a series of exercises laid out in an RMarkdown file. I use the markdown text to give instructions and then have blank code chunks where people put their solutions. See an example here.

David will create this and add you to the repo. 2.2 Project Organization 2.3 Slides 2.3.1 Slides Template Slides for R for the Rest of Us courses are made using the xaringan package. There is a custom template to use to make slides in the R for the Rest of Us style. You can access this by installing the rruthemes package using the following code: devtools::install_github(&quot;rfortherestofus/rruthemes&quot;) Please create a slides directory where all of your slides will live. You can create slides as follows: 2.3.2 Slides Organization Each lesson should have a My Turn and a Your Turn section. The slide for the My Turn section should have an orange background and the slide for the Your Turn section should have a blue background. To do this, add the class my-turn and the class inverse to your slides as follows: "],["rstudio-setup.html", "3 RStudio Setup 3.1 Defaults", " 3 RStudio Setup 3.1 Defaults Please use default fonts while you are teaching. Pretty as they are, please don’t use fonts like Fira Code, as the differences in how they render the assignment operator, for example, can be confusing for newbies.

"],["recording-videos.html", "5 Recording Videos 5.1 Streamlabs Setup 5.2 Recording Procedures 5.3 Sharing Videos with David", " 5 Recording Videos 5.1 Streamlabs Setup I use the free Streamlabs to record videos. It’s designed for streaming online, but you can also use it to record locally. I use all of the default settings for audio and video. I record videos with my screen displaying and myself on video in the bottom right. I think it’s important that the instructor be on video to build rapport with students. I made a video to show I set this up in Streamlabs. And here’s the video I reference in the above video showing the result. You can download the circle mask I use to make the video of you round here. 5.2 Recording Procedures I’m generally not that fussy about making sure everything is super high quality, but please use an external camera and external mic to record. Please put your mic as close to you as possible, but make sure it doesn’t show up on camera. If you are interested in learning some tips about high-quality screencasting, this guide from Egghead is helpful. My general experience is that it’s easier to record videos by just hitting record and going through your lesson as many times as you need to. I often make mistakes along the way, but that’s ok because we can edit them out after the fact. Just go back to right before you messed up and start again! You can, of course, record so you get a single high-quality take, but I find that hard to do and way too much pressure. 5.3 Sharing Videos with David Please share the raw videos you record in the Google Drive folder that David sets up for you. Make sure they are labelled so I know what each video is. "]]
