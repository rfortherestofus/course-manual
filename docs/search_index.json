The overall process from start to finish looks something like this: Intro Call Go over terms Discuss timing Share course-making manual Confirm instructor has access to external camera and mic Contract + Advance David + instructor sign contract and David pays advance to instructor Set up Infrastructure David sets up shared Google Drive folder David creates Google Sheet for course outline Develop Outline Explain how lessons work (e.g. video, your turn, solutions, learn more) Develop slides David shares rruthemes package to be used Instructor develops slides David approves slides Record Videos Instructor records single test video David approves test video Instructor records remaining videos, including solutions Edit videos David’s video editor edits videos Put content on website Final approval from instructor Marketing for course launch David + instructor develop email sequence David + instructor plan out social media launch Add content to website Make landing page for course All material added to website Course launch! "],["legal-and-financial.html", "1 Legal and Financial 1.1 Compensation 1.2 Ownership 1.3 Exclusivity 1.4 Agreement Expiration", " 1 Legal and Financial Here are the legal and financial terms that I typically use when working with course instructors. I’m flexible and happy to work with you to come up with a solution that meets both of our needs. 1.1 Compensation I pay an advance to the course creator of between $500, half on signing the contract to work together, and the other half when all videos for the course are recorded and uploaded to Google Drive. Revenue for the courses is split 60/40 (60% for R for the Rest of Us, 40% for the course creator). I pay any royalties owed to the course creator on a quarterly basis. 1.2 Ownership All videos are owned by R for the Rest of Us. All non-video materials will be made freely available on the R for the Rest of Us organization GitHub using a CC-BY-SA-4.0 License. 1.3 Exclusivity The instructor agrees not to create a course that covers the same topic on another online platform for at least 12 months from the release of this course. 1.4 Agreement Expiration These terms remain in effect for one year after the course is released. After that, David and the instructor will discuss any possible changes to the terms. "],["curriculum-development.html", "2 Curriculum Development 2.1 Lesson Content", " 2 Curriculum Development You’ll develop your curriculum as a combination of slides, exercises, and examples. Here’s how I’ve used the three, but please note that this is just my approach. I want you to think about what’s going to work best for your materials. I start out each section of my course with slides. In my courses, a section is RMarkdown or data wrangling and analysis or data visualization. I have a slide with the section title that I display as I talk through an overview of that section. Each lesson within a section should be short and focus on a single topic. As you’re making your materials, if you think that a video demonstrating the concept will go beyond 5 minutes or so, consider breaking it into multiple lessons. I typically start a lesson with slides. I’ll start with a slide that lays out the concept. I’ll often have code on this slide. I’ll usually then flip over to RStudio to show myself typing out the code to demonstrate this concept in an exercises file. You can see an example of a whole lesson, complete with all parts here. 2.1 Lesson Content I usually use a Google Sheet to help collaborate with the instructor on course materials. Here’s a sample of what the Google Sheet includes. The Google Sheet has places for thinking about lesson content, data, exercises, solutions, and learn more resources. "],["course-materials.html", "3 Course Materials 3.1 GitHub Repo 3.2 Project Organization 3.3 Slides", " 3 Course Materials 3.1 GitHub Repo Each course will have a GitHub repo on the R for the Rest of Us organization account. David will create this and add you to the repo. 3.2 Project Organization 3.3 Slides 3.3.1 Slides Template Slides for R for the Rest of Us courses are made using the xaringan package. There is a custom template to use to make slides in the R for the Rest of Us style. You can access this by installing the rruthemes package using the following code: devtools::install_github(&quot;rfortherestofus/rruthemes&quot;) Please create a slides directory where all of your slides will live. You can create slides as follows: 3.3.2 Slides Organization Each lesson should have a My Turn and a Your Turn section. The slide for the My Turn section should have an orange background and the slide for the Your Turn section should have a blue background. To do this, add the class my-turn and the class inverse to your slides as follows: "],["rstudio-setup.html", "4 RStudio Setup 4.1 Defaults", " 4 RStudio Setup 4.1 Defaults Please use default fonts while you are teaching. Pretty as they are, please don’t use fonts like Fira Code, as the differences in how they render the assignment operator, for example, can be confusing for newbies. "],["code-style.html", "5 Code Style", " 5 Code Style Please follow the tidyverse style guide as closely as possible. The most important thing is to have code that is easy to read for new learners. You’re welcome to use the styler package to format your code. "],["recording-videos.html", "6 Recording Videos 6.1 Streamlabs Setup 6.2 Recording Procedures 6.3 Sharing Videos with David", " 6 Recording Videos 6.1 Streamlabs Setup I use the free Streamlabs to record videos. It’s designed for streaming online, but you can also use it to record locally. I use all of the default settings for audio and video. I record videos with my screen displaying and myself on video in the bottom right. I think it’s important that the instructor be on video to build rapport with students. I made a video to show I set this up in Streamlabs. And here’s the video I reference in the above video showing the result. You can download the circle mask I use to make the video of you round here. 6.2 Recording Procedures I’m generally not that fussy about making sure everything is super high quality, but please use an external camera and external mic to record. Please put your mic as close to you as possible, but make sure it doesn’t show up on camera. If you are interested in learning some tips about high-quality screencasting, this guide from Egghead is helpful. My general experience is that it’s easier to record videos by just hitting record and going through your lesson as many times as you need to. I often make mistakes along the way, but that’s ok because we can edit them out after the fact. Just go back to right before you messed up and start again! You can, of course, record so you get a single high-quality take, but I find that hard to do and way too much pressure. 6.3 Sharing Videos with David Please share the raw videos you record in the Google Drive folder that David sets up for you. Make sure they are labeled so I know what each video is. "],["video-editing.html", "7 Video Editing", " 7 Video Editing David has a video editor who will edit all of your videos. "]]
